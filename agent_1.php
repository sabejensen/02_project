       <h2>Biography</h2>
       <p> I have loved travel for as long as I can remember. At the age of 12 I asked if I could fly by myself
        to Hawaii and I never came back.<br>
        Right out of high school I started into travel school and have had the opportunity to work in many
        aspects of the industry. In every aspect I have worked I have had the opportunity to help people
        travel, to help fulfill people?s dreams, what could be beWer to do every day</p>
